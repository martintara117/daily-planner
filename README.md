# daily-planner

## Description

The Daily-Planner challenged us to create a schedule that used real time. The planner shows the date and time, and uses this to illustrate whether an event in in the past, present or future based on color. If it is grey then it happened in the past. If it is red, it is currently happening. If it is green, it is happening in the future. Users may use the time slots- which range from 9 am to 5 pm - to type their schedule for each given time and save. Once a user has saved, text is placed in local storage and will be available next time the planner is opened.

## Acceptance Criteria
